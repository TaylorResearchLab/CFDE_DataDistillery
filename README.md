# UBKG
The **Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG)** is a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) database that represents a set of interrelated concepts from biomedical ontologies and vocabularies. The UBKG combines information from the National Library of Medicine's [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) (UMLS) with [_assertions_](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Assertions) from “non-UMLS” ontologies or vocabularies, including:
- Ontologies published in references such as the [NCBO Bioportal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/) and the [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/).
- Custom ontologies derived from data sources such as [UNIPROTKB](https://www.uniprot.org/).
- Other custom ontologies, such as those for the [HuBMAP](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) platform.

An important goal of the UBKG is to establish connections between ontologies. For example,if information on the relationships between _proteins_ and _genes_ described in one ontology can be connected to information on the relationships between _genes_ and _diseases_ described in another ontology, it may be possible to identify previously unknown relationships between _proteins_ and _diseases_.
