# User Guide
Adding assertions to the Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG)

# Objectives
This guide describes how to format assertions as an ontology so that the ontology can be added to the Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph database. The guide includes recommendations for optimizing and deepening the integration of an ontology into the UBKG to establish new relationships among entities and cross-references among ontologies.

# Audience
This guide is intended for users who are subject matter experts in what biomedical assertions they might want to represent (e.g., genes and their products), as an ontology, but not necessarily conversant with either ontological concepts or knowledge graphs.

The Appendix describes terms that this guide uses that are relevant to ontologies or knowledge graphs. The first reference to a term in the guide will contain a link to the term in the Appendix.
